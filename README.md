**Potential Idea** - From Todd  
'5d Tic-Tac-Toe'  

I don't know if this is exactly what you mean, but the version of tic-tac-toe where you go *into* another tic-tac-toe game based on your choices
Great for:
- Simple but complex
- Intersting idea to place into a website (if wanted)
- AI player could be interesting to code out as well!
